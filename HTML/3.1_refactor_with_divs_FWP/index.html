        <p>
          Lital was born in 29th January 1989, in Israel. since a young age of
          her life, she was very musical. her first instrument was keyboards, on
          the age of 8. she began to play very first compare all others in the
          class, so she jumped right away to the second class of keyboards
          class. after one year or so, Lital wanted to proceed with playing the
          keyboard so she decided to study piano! she took private lessons with
          a private nice teacher named Lena. Unfortunately, Lital's parents
          couldn't afford these days to buy a real piano, what forces Lital to
          keep on practice piano's melodies on the regular keyboards, but that
          situation effected her very badly and after two years, Lital decided
          to stop taking lessons.
        </p>

        <p>
          On the age of 12, Lital decided to learn to play on the guitar. since
          her older brother played the guitar and there was a guitar at her
          home, she bought a chords book and learned alone by herself (and the
          chords book) playing the guitar. Lital felt very connected with the
          guitar and the process went quite well for her. also in those years,
          the internet developed and Lital was able to learn how to read guitar
          tabs, so she always found a short term of time to connect the internet
          (which caught the regular phone line at home these days) and download
          fast all tabs of each song she was willing to learn to play on the
          guitar.
        </p>

        <p>
          When Lital got to high school, she entered to a music class. she
          already learned to play on electric guitar and play solos of many
          popular bands such as Pink Floyd, Beatles, Metallica, Nirvana, Led
          Zeppelin, etc...she got very professional and enjoyed every music
          class she entered. also Music is the highest grade of her high school
          diploma.
        </p>

        <p>
          In the same days, Lital tried also to entered computers class, but she
          couldn't make it since she felt like her destiny belongs to music
          only.
        </p>

        <p>
          After Lital finished high school, she enters to army service, as a
          Teacher Soldier to deaf teenagers which needed help with preparation
          for matriculation. Lital learned the sign language, and that is how
          she was able to communicate with those teenagers.
        </p>

        <p>
          During her military service, one of Lital's best friends,Adir, died in
          a kit surfing accident. The loss was traumatic and difficult for her.
          One of the nights during seven days of the grief, she dreamed of him
          and the dream led Lital to write and compose a song about him. When
          Lital played the song to Adir's parents, they were so excited and it
          was decided that they were going to look for a music producer and a
          recording studio to make this song happen.
        </p>

        <p>
          After the music producer with whom the song was produced was found,
          Lital entered the studio with the producer and they started working.
          At this point in Lital's life, she realized what she wanted to do
          "when she grew up." Lital wanted to be a music producer herself, she
          wanted to learn how to record instruments herself, run audio recording
          software, know how to create good sound, know how to mix and, in fact,
          know how to do everything from scratch.
        </p>

        <p>
          and so it was! Lital fulfilled her dream as a musician, and to date,
          has been working in the music industry for 14 years. Lital has worked
          with well-known artists from the top ranks of the Israeli music
          industry: Harel Moyal, Margol, Yishai Levy, Tzvika Pick, Zehava Ben,
          Yishai Rivo, Amir Banyon, Nasrin Kadri, Michal Shapira, Shlomo Bar,
          Itai Levy, Yasmin Levy and many more.
        </p>

        <p>
          In 2019 Lital went through a difficult crisis, which caused her deep
          heartache, which led her to non-stop writing and composing 11 songs.
          This is how Little Singularity's first album was born, <span class="enhanced">which will be
          released on August 8, 2023.</span>
        </p>

        <p>
          During Lital's musical career, Lital found herself completely by
          chance, entering a job at a small high-tech start-up, which developed
          a music application and was just looking for a musician and sound man.
          Luckily for Little, she was a good fit for the company and that's how
          Little was exposed to the high-tech world for the first time. After a
          few years as a project manager in the same company, Little worked in
          another company as a project manager, while starting to learn Python,
          Java Script, html and the rest is history :)
        </p>

        <p>
          Lital is a rare example of a person who fulfilled her dream and also
          found her love for development. Lital is admittedly only at the
          beginning of her journey, but with perseverance and dedication like
          she has - the sky is the limit, and she will go far :)
